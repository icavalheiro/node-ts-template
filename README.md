# NodeJS Application

This is a template for a NodeJS application running rollup and typescript.

Everything is setup to work properly with VSCode.

## Commands

To build the project simple: `npm run build`.

And during development, remember to keep rollup in watch mode with `npm run dev`.

All the generated files will be placed in `dist/`, VSCode is already setup to run debugger mode from that folder, so `F5` should work out of the box.
